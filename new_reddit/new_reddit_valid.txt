so you think iran would try and deploy their most advanced weapons in israel ?|i 'm concerned with dirty bombs , which is their most advanced weapon

injuries and time on his arm , i think he lead the league in innings pitched multiple years in a row .|cc can still be good if he finds a new way to put hitters away . it 's not like he was getting hammered on the first pitch , he would go 0 - 2 or 1 - 2 and then leave a fastball up in the zone .
like the backpack , dude !|thanks man !
do n't have a credit card , and i 'm in canada . i also would prefer brand new , and not used .|why are we downvoting this response ? if he 's having to pay in cash , and wants a new card , a physical store is his only guarantee of getting it .

depends , you gonna tell me you actually care about me from time to time instead of treating me like a toy ? if the answer is yes i 'll buy a plane ticket lol .|i tell my boyfriend how handsome he is . i like telling him i love him and stuff . i think if you love someone then you should want to express it , i do n't get how you would n't !
thanks for the advice . but i need something non - physical . i do n't want to get in trouble with my asian parents .|i 'm asian too . i know what your talking about . making them feel insecure will probably mess with a guy real good . if they call you ugly , call them hideous

i was gonna be so happy if yall had fired him . i think he could easily find success elsewhere , but idk if the next guy could build on what he 's done .|a lot of great coaches have come through stillwater but none of them have accomplished as much as gundy . it definitely takes a special breed to coach there .

a keyboard is a good idea , but that specific keyboard looks a little too small to work properly . being able to connect a small bluetooth keyboard to it would make more sense .|i actually have a flimsy keyboard about that size . it 's a lot easier than you think . i have big hands . do n't underestimate yourself . i like the little keyboard .
even before the millions , he at least could be offered a free ride to college . hopefully he could continue weightlifting as well if that 's the case . but we 'll see in a few years|very true , the possibility of getting a scholarship from a great academic program is very hard to turn down .

what exactly does that stat mean ?|while on the floor , their team was plus or minus that many points relative to the other team .
that 's a one - in - a - million situation , but reddit hates homeless people and thinks there is an epidemic of women lying about rape , so of course they 'll latch on to it .|it 's just an example of the 100 things that could go badly if you invite a random homeless person into your house .

why would they have to stop the attack ? why not make an anonymous tip or just leave .|reason would change from group to group i 'd wager , some would be told a bounty is on their leaders head , others might just want to save some folks .
is anyone with me in thinking sarcasm tags ruin sarcasm ? if you 're too stupid to get it , you should n't have your hand held .|a lot of the time , you can only tell it 's sarcasm through the tone in the person 's voice . you ca n't hear that when the message is in text .

apple making a shitty product color me fucking surprised .|given the quality of the iphone and them being what , a year late on a smartwatch , i 'd say a bad product is a surprise .

patch notes : - destiny is now self aware|no fate but what we make .
in terms of team pick order : the team with the most available spots to fill should be prioritize first , then the team with the worst performance .|i do n't think so , i think the priority should be decided by the captains like it was done last draft . it goes in order . if one team already has filled it spots their turn is just skipped .

i found it to be alright until the very end , and then the difficulty took a weird extreme upswing and i ragequit . still never finished it .|the difficulty curve definitely was out of whack . the game was super easy until the end . it really needed to raise the curve at the start so that the end would n't be as difficult as it was .
